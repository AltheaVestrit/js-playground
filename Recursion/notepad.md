Five steps for solving any recursive problem:

1. What's the simplest possible input?
2. Play around with examples and visualize!
3. Relate hard cases to simpler cases
4. Generalize the pattern
5. Write code by combining recursive pattern with base case


[3,2,1,13] [8,5,0,1]
[3,2] [1,13] [8,5] [0,1]
